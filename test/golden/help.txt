Usage: spremuta [--version] [--verbose | --debug] [--notify ARG] COMMAND

  spremuta runs in two modes: "spremuta task TASK" runs the given task and exits
  immediately. "spremuta daemon" continuously reads tasks from the
  spremuta.tasks file.

Available options:
  -h,--help                Show this help text
  --version                Show version
  --verbose                Output more logs. Useful for creating detailed
                           issues. Use --debug for even more logs.
  --debug                  Output a maximum number of logs. Useful for
                           developers.
  --notify ARG             Command to execute to notify the user (split on
                           spaces). Defaults to "notify-send" on Linux. On other
                           OSes, write to stdout (feel free to enhance that by
                           modifying 'setDefaultNotify' in Options.hs).

Available commands:
  task
